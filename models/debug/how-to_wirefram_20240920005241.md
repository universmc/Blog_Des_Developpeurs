Please provide me with more context! I need to know what you want to wireframe before I can write a how-to guide.  

For example, tell me:

* **What type of thing are you wireframing?** 
    * A website?
    * A mobile app?
    * A specific feature within an app?
    * A document layout?
* **What tool are you using to wireframe?** 
    * Figma?
    * Sketch?
    * Balsamiq?
    * Pen and paper?
* **What is your level of experience with wireframing?** 
    * Beginner?
    * Intermediate?
    * Advanced?


Once I have this information, I can create a helpful and specific how-to guide for you.
