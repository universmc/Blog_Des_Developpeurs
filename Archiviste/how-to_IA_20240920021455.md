It seems like you're asking for a guide on how to generate a How-To guide! That's a meta-guide, which is pretty cool.  

Here's a breakdown of how to create a helpful and effective How-To guide, focusing on the "IA" aspect (which I'm assuming stands for "Instructional Design").

**1. Define Your Audience & Purpose**

* **Who are you writing for?**  Beginners, experts, a specific age group? Understanding your audience's knowledge level and needs is crucial.
* **What do you want them to achieve?** Clearly state the goal of the guide.  "How to bake a chocolate cake" is more specific than "How to bake."

**2.  Structure Your Guide**

* **Introduction:**
    *  Hook your reader with a compelling opening.
    *  Clearly state the purpose and scope of the guide.
    *  Outline the steps involved.
* **Body:**
    *  **Step-by-step instructions:** Use clear, concise language.
    *  **Visuals:**  Include images, diagrams, or videos to illustrate steps. 
    *  **Chunking:** Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps.
    *  **Active voice:**  "Click the button" is more direct than "The button should be clicked."
* **Conclusion:**
    *  Summarize key points.
    *  Offer troubleshooting tips or common mistakes to avoid.
    *  Encourage feedback or questions.

**3.  Write Engaging Content**

* **Keep it conversational:**  Write as if you're talking to a friend.
* **Use examples:**  Relate instructions to real-world scenarios.
* **Avoid jargon:** Use plain language that everyone can understand.
* **Proofread carefully:**  Errors can make your guide seem unprofessional.

**4.  IA Considerations (Instructional Design)**

* **Learning Objectives:**  What specific knowledge or skills should readers gain?
* **Assessment:**  How will you ensure readers understand the material? (e.g., quizzes, exercises)
* **Feedback:**  Provide opportunities for readers to get feedback on their progress.
* **Accessibility:**  Make your guide accessible to all learners, including those with disabilities.

**5.  Tools & Resources**

* **Word processors:**  Microsoft Word, Google Docs
* **Graphic design tools:**  Canva, Adobe Photoshop
* **Screen recording software:**  Camtasia, Loom
* **Online learning platforms:**  Articulate Storyline, Moodle
